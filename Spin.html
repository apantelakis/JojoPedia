    <title>Power Systems: Spin</title>

<body>
    <h1>Spin:</h1>
    <p>
        The Spin, literally meaning rotation when directly translated, is a power used by the protagonists of Steel Ball Run
        and some key characters of JoJolion. It is the embodiment of the golden ratio or golden spiral which is commonly
        associated with “perfection” as it is the perfect balance between addition and multiplication. It is similar to the
        power of the ripple from Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency. A mathematical endless spiral which gives birth to an
        infinitely growing rotational power that can be transferred to objects in the forms of vibrations. (Similar to the
        ripple in this sense too)
    </p>
    <h1>Overview: </h1>
    The Spin is a rotational power derived from the golden rectangle and the Fibonacci sequence. Similarly to hamon it has a
    lot of unique uses but follows the following principle. Users pick an object and apply a small rotational force to it
    which they let perpetuate and get faster, aiming to acquire the golden spiral to attain the infinite spin. Although it
    seems easy to learn, mastery of it is near impossible as it is hard to image the golden ratio every time you apply the
    spin to an object. You also need to be experienced in throwing since most users opt to apply the spin on objects before
    throwing them, seen by Gyro’s and the Zeppeli family’s use of the steel balls.

    <h1>Feats: </h1>
    Although generally used as an enhancement to users’ destructive power, strengthen the physical body or heal it has a diverse range of unique powers.
    <ul>
        <li> Masters of the Spin believe that the steel ball is the perfect tool to apply rotational force to as perfect spheres
            can acquire the infinite rotation users aim to achieve. </li>
        
        <li> Johnny’s application of the spin was more unique due to his stand Tusk giving him metaphysical properties. He was
            able to use the spin on his finger and toe nails giving them bullet like properties and growing them out faster</li>
        
        <li>The Super Spin, also known as the Golden Spin, is the most accurate human replication of the golden spiral.
        
            Developed in the Middle Ages to counter mounted knights' armor, it utilizes the energy of a galloping horse moving
            at its natural pace, aligned with the proportions of the Golden Rectangle. This harmony generates the energy of the
            Spin, transferred through stirrups to the rider's body, empowering a projectile, such as a steel ball, with perfect
            rotational force and infinite energy. The Super Spin is linked to the ability to produce gravity, theorized as the
            only force capable of transcending dimensions.
        
            Mastering the Super Spin unlocks incredible powers, including evolving a Stand to its ultimate form. For example, a
            steel ball thrown using the Spin summons Ball Breaker, while Johnny Joestar attains Tusk Act 4. These entities
            embody the infinite energy of the Spin, capable of overcoming dimensional barriers like D4C Love Train and resisting
            even time-stopping powers like The World.
        
            However, the technique is exceedingly difficult to execute. It requires a healthy horse, precise timing to align
            with the horse's natural pace, mastery of the Spin, and the ability to flawlessly imbue a projectile with the
            rotation. Any disruption, such as obstacles or attacks, will interrupt the process. During the events of Steel Ball
            Run, only Johnny Joestar and Gyro Zeppeli successfully wielded the Super Spin. </li>

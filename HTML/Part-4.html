                    <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
                    <p>This part follows Josuke Higashikata, a high school student in the town of Morioh, and
                        his companions as they uncover the mysteries surrounding their town while battling Stand users.
                        Jotaro Kujo arrives in Morioh to inform Josuke, the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar, about
                        his
                        heritage. Josuke,
                        whose Stand Crazy Diamond can repair and heal, teams up with Jotaro after defeating the Stand
                        user
                        Angelo, who
                        reveals
                        the existence of a Bow and Arrow capable of granting Stands. <br>

                        Josuke's group, including Koichi Hirose and Okuyasu Nijimura, confront various Stand users, many
                        of
                        whom were
                        created by
                        Okuyasu's late brother Keicho in an attempt to end their father's monstrous existence. After
                        recovering the Bow and
                        Arrow from Akira Otoishi, the group faces new threats, including eccentric manga artist Rohan
                        Kishibe, and other
                        unique
                        stand users. <br> Their encounters eventually lead them to uncover the
                        presence of a serial killer, Yoshikage Kira, who uses his Stand Killer Queen to cover up his
                        crimes
                        and maintain a
                        quiet life. The conflict intensifies when Kira, exposed by his murder of Shigekiyo, assumes a
                        new
                        identity and gains allies,
                        including a hybrid Stand-plant called Stray Cat. After killing Hayato Kawajiri, the son of his
                        assumed identity,
                        Kira in his panick gains a new ability, Bites the Dust, which rewinds time and ensures his
                        identity
                        remains hidden. However, Hayato
                        exploits this power to expose Kira to Josuke and his allies.

                    <p>In the climactic battle, Josuke, Okuyasu, and Hayato face off against Kira, who uses Stray Cat to
                        create invisible
                        bombs. Despite heavy losses and near-death experiences, the group outmaneuvers Kira, and Jotaro
                        delivers the final
                        blow
                        with Star Platinum. Kira is killed when he is accidentally struck by an ambulance, and his ghost
                        is
                        dragged into an
                        unknown fate by spectral hands in Ghost Alley.

                        With the killer defeated and peace restored to Morioh, the group bids farewell to Reimi
                        Sugimoto, a
                        ghost whose
                        guidance
                        helped them in their quest. As summer ends, Jotaro and Joseph leave Morioh, and Josuke reflects
                        on
                        his experiences
                        and
                        the bonds he formed.

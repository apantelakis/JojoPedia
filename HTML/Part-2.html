            <h1>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 2 - Battle Tendency</h1>
            <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
            <p>Battle Tendency is the second part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. It was serialized in Weekly Shonen Jump
                from 1987 to
                1989 and adapted into a 2012 TV series by David Productions. It follows the adventures of Joseph
                Joestar, the
                grandson of Jonathan Joestar, the protagonist of the first part, Phantom Blood. The main conflict arises
                from
                ancient beings called the Pillar Men, creators of the Stone Mask, who desire a one-of-a-kind artifact
                known as the
                Red Stone of Aja to become ultimate beings. </p>

            <p>After Joseph and Caesar, the grandson of Will Antonio Zeppeli (who trained Joseph's grandfather,
                Jonathan), become
                entangled in the Pillar Men's plot, they are given one month to master Hamon and defeat the Pillar Men.
                Otherwise,
                the poison implanted in them as a condition for their survival will kill them. Under the harsh training
                of Lisa
                Lisa—the foremost Hamon expert, who is later revealed to be Joseph's mother—and her two servants,
                Loggins and
                Messina, Joseph begins to grow stronger. Joseph eventually defeats the Pillar Man Esidisi, who had
                killed Loggins
                while successfully stealing the Red Stone of Aja and sending it to Switzerland. </p>

            <p>With only a few days remaining, Joseph and his group pursue the Red Stone, seeking to retrieve it before
                Kars, the
                leader of the Pillar Men, succeeds in his plan. In their quest, they are aided by the Nazi army and its
                commander,
                Stroheim. With their assistance, they locate the Pillar Men, leading to intense battles. Caesar dies in
                combat
                against Wamuu, and Lisa Lisa is severely injured by Kars. With the inadvertent help of the Nazis, Kars
                transcends
                into the ultimate lifeform. Confident in his superiority, Kars chases Joseph into a volcano. However,
                Joseph uses
                his Hamon, which rivals the power of the sun’s surface, to set off the volcano, leading to Kars being
                launched into
                space, forever trapped in the vacuum.</p>

            <p>
                Joseph miraculously survives the eruption and surprises everyone by showing up at his own funeral,
                reuniting with
                his friends.

                    <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
                    <p> The story begins with Joseph Joestar befriending a young man named Smokey. Joseph learns of the
                        presumed death of
                        Speedwagon at the hands of Straizo, who has transformed into a vampire. Joseph confronts Straizo
                        and kills him.
                        Meanwhile, Speedwagon has been kidnapped by the Nazi party in Brazil, who need his expertise on
                        vampires to help
                        them study the revived Pillar Man, Santana.
                        Santana eventually escapes Nazi captivity and nearly kills Speedwagon before Joseph intervenes.
                        Joseph defeats
                        Santana and saves Speedwagon, who informs him that three other Pillar Men have been discovered
                        sleeping beneath the
                        Colosseum in Rome. Joseph travels to Rome, where he meets Caesar Antonio Zeppeli, the grandson
                        of Will Antonio
                        Zeppeli. Together, they visit the underground site where the Pillar Men awaken and massacre the
                        German soldiers
                        stationed there.
                        Joseph and Caesar attempt to fight the Pillar Man Wamuu but are easily overpowered. Wamuu
                        implants poison rings into
                        both Joseph and Caesar, giving them 33 days to defeat him and earn the antidote. </p>

                    <p> Joseph and Caesar begin training under Lisa Lisa and her servants, Loggins and Messina. During
                        this time, Joseph
                        meets Suzie Q for the first time. However, Joseph’s training is interrupted when Esidisi kills
                        Loggins and steals
                        the Red Stone of Aja. Joseph defeats Esidisi but cannot prevent him from sending the Stone to
                        Kars.
                        The group travels to Switzerland, where, with the help of Stroheim, they locate Kars and
                        retrieve the Red Stone.
                        Caesar and Messina launch a hasty attack on the Pillar Men’s hideout, leading to Caesar’s death
                        at the hands of
                        Wamuu. In a final act, Caesar steals the antidote from Wamuu and delivers it to Joseph before
                        succumbing to his
                        injuries. Joseph and Lisa Lisa mourn Caesar’s death and vow to defeat the Pillar Men. </p>

                    <p> Joseph fulfills his promise to Wamuu by challenging him to a chariot duel in a newly built
                        colosseum. After a
                        hard-fought battle, Joseph defeats Wamuu and drinks the antidote. Meanwhile, Kars tricks Lisa
                        Lisa during their
                        duel, using a vampire double to stab her in the back and steal the Red Stone.
                        Kars summons an army of vampires to kill the injured Hamon users, but they are incinerated by
                        Stroheim’s platoon and
                        the Speedwagon Foundation, who use UV lights to mimic sunlight. Seizing this opportunity, Kars
                        uses the Red Stone of
                        Aja with a custom Stone Mask to ascend into the ultimate lifeform.
                        Now invincible, Kars basks in the sunlight and pursues Joseph for revenge. Joseph lures Kars to
                        a volcano, where he
                        discovers that even lava cannot harm him. As Kars gloats over his victory, he uses Hamon to
                        finish off Joseph.
                        However, Joseph redirects Kars’ attack into the volcano using the Red Stone, triggering an
                        eruption that launches
                        Kars into space. Trapped in the vacuum of space and unable to die, Kars becomes an eternal,
                        lifeless rock.
                        Weeks later, at Joseph’s funeral, his friends are shocked when Joseph appears, alive and well.
                        He explains that he
                        was saved by a fisherman and reveals that he married Suzie Q in Italy. The part ends humorously,
                        with Joseph chasing
                        Suzie after she forgot to inform his friends that he was alive, while his friends celebrate his
                        return.

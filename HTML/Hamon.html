                    <p>Hamon, literally meaning Ripple, is the power to channel one’s energy into sun waves. Through
                        controlled breathing
                        and thorough training a trainee can produce energy that ripples through their body or other
                        objects
                        to mimic the
                        power of the sun. It is said that liquids conduct hamon better than any other object. They can
                        output this energy
                        through attacks, techniques or imbue it into weapons and objects, it has also been used to heal
                        before.
                        It is the main power system of the protagonists in Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency and used
                        briefly by Joseph
                        Joestar in Stardust Crusaders, but it was mainly disregarded after the first two parts.

                    <h1>Overview: </h1>
                    Hamon was first shown in Chapter 18 of Jojo’s Bizzare Adventures: Phantom Blood, used by William
                    Anthonio Zeppeli under
                    the alias “Baron”.
                    Using his pinky he pierced Jonathan’s diaphragm forcing him to produce hamon energy healing his arm
                    in
                    the process,
                    proceeding to explain that “Sendo” is an art from the east that channels Hamon energy into ripples
                    spreading through the
                    body by breathing in a special way. Zeppeli notices an innate talent for hamon in Jojo and proceeds
                    to
                    train him,
                    teaching him the ins and outs of hamon energy. During this training period Zeppeli explains that
                    anyone
                    can breathe
                    instinctively, the difference between a normal person and a hamon user is learning how to control
                    the
                    rhythm of their
                    breathing, not letting it waver under any circumstance. Creating the energy of the sun using your
                    own
                    blood flow and
                    oxygen, that is the secret of hamon.More and more applications of hamon have been shown as the parts
                    proceeded, in Battle Tendency Caesar Zeppeli used
                    his hamon to control people while Joseph Joestar used his to make people pass out, similar to over
                    exposure in the sun.
                    A common theme in attacks using hamon is the wound being very hot, in some cases melting body parts.
                    Some unique characteristics of training the ripple were shown in Parts 1 and 2. Master Tonpetty, of
                    the
                    Tibetan monks
                    who taught William Zeppeli had acquired the power of clairvoyance and Lisa Lisa used the hamon
                    energy to
                    preserve her
                    youth throughout the years.
                    <br> The only noticeable weaknesses of hamon is distributing the flow of oxygen in the user, shown
                    by
                    Dio in Part 1
                    where he froze Jonathan’s allies and pierced his trachea and Wamuu in Part 2 exclaiming that Caesar
                    was
                    unable to fight
                    anymore due to excessive blood loss.

                    <h1>Training Regime: </h1>
                    As breathing is a key part of harnessing hamon energy all of its users have been shown to undergo
                    vigorous cardio and
                    aerobic activities. Beyond the basic rhythm training hamon masters have procured unique training
                    regimes
                    to pass on to
                    their students. Will. A. Zeppeli made Jonathan learn Sendo, the martial art that uses hamon while
                    also
                    training in
                    nature to further connect to the power bestowed upon Earth by the Sun.
                    <br>
                    Caesar and Joseph underwent the “Pillar of Hell”, a 24 meter pillar with a slippery surface that is
                    in
                    the center of a
                    pit. Implemented into the pillar is a system that sends oil down its surface continuously and traps
                    embedded into the
                    walls. They were both thrown down the pit and Lisa Lisa explained that the power of hamon is the
                    only
                    way to climb up,
                    forcing them into a life or death situation to master their control over the ripple.
                    Special breathing masks were also used, specifically by Joseph Joestar who had to master hamon in a
                    short time span.

                    <h1>Feats: </h1>
                    Hamon users all have come up with unique ways to channel the ripple, beyond basic attacks. Such as
                    the
                    following.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Forced breathing, demonstrated by Will A. Zeppeli.</li>
                        <li>Zoom punch, dislocating your joints to elongate your arm and attack your target.</li>
                        <li>Hamon overdrive, channeling your ripple into a spiral and sending it through an object to
                            attack
                            whatever is on the other side.</li>
                        <li>Elemental attacks such as scarlet and turquoise overdrive, creating flames or sending water
                            flying.</li>
                        <li>Sunlight Yellow overdrive, a technique channeling all your hamon into an all out attack.
                        </li>
                        <li>Bubble launcher and cutter, Caesar Zeppeli used bubbles charged with hamon to send out
                            attacks.
                        </li>

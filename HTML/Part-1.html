                <h1>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 1 - Phantom Blood</h1>
                <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
                <p>Phantom Blood is the first part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. It was serialized in Weekly Shonen Jump from
                    1986 to 1987 and adapted into a movie in 2007 by Studio A.P.P.P. and a 2012 TV series by David Productions.
                    This part follows the adventures of a wealthy British man named Jonathan Joestar, nicknamed JoJo by his
                    friends, and his adoptive brother, Dio Brando. The main conflict in this part stems from Dio's betrayal of
                    the Joestar family and his transformation into a vampire. After Jonathan burns down his ancestral mansion in
                    an attempt to destroy Dio, he is instructed in the way of Hamon by Will Antonio Zeppeli, a martial art that
                    harnesses the power of sunlight to destroy vampires. As Jonathan becomes more adept at Hamon by defeating
                    Dio's underlings and recruiting allies, Dio grows increasingly knowledgeable about his vampiric powers. In
                    their final battle, Jonathan appears to defeat Dio. However, three months later, while on his honeymoon
                    cruise with Erina, Jonathan is ambushed by Dio, who attempts to restore his body by stealing Jonathan's.
                    Jonathan succumbs to his injuries during the final battle, dying while holding Dio's severed head. Erina
                    escapes the exploding ship by hiding in Dio's coffin and is later rescued near the Canary Islands.

                <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
                <p>The story begins with Jonathan Joestar and his father, George Joestar, wounded in a stagecoach
                    accident that kills
                    Jonathan's mother. Dio's father, Dario Brando, finds the wreckage and attempts to loot their bodies;
                    however, George
                    perceives his actions as a rescue attempt and promises Dario a favor in return for "saving" their
                    lives. Years
                    later, after Dario's wife's death, he is left to raise Dio on his own, which causes Dio to develop a
                    twisted
                    personality due to his father's abusive behavior. On his deathbed, Dario instructs Dio to cash in
                    the favor and live
                    with the Joestars. After Dario's funeral, during which Dio spits on his father's grave, Dio moves to
                    the Joestar
                    manor and is adopted by George Joestar. Immediately, Dio hatches a scheme to become the heir to the
                    Joestar fortune
                    and begins to torment Jonathan, hitting his dog, Danny, and violently beating him in a boxing match.
                    Dio also tries
                    to gain George's favor by displaying superior gentlemanly qualities and academic skills compared to
                    Jonathan. When
                    Jonathan finds solace in his budding relationship with Erina, Dio assaults her, stealing her first
                    kiss. Enraged,
                    Jonathan punches Dio hard enough to draw blood, which splatters onto an ancient stone mask in the
                    mansion, causing
                    spikes to extend. Both Jonathan and Dio believe the mask to be a torture device. Later, Dio burns
                    Danny alive in an
                    incinerator, biding his time to gain Jonathan's trust.</p>
                <p>Years pass, and Dio and Jonathan appear to grow closer, both becoming star students and athletes
                    nearing graduation.
                    However, George Joestar falls gravely ill, and Jonathan grows suspicious of Dio's overly caring
                    attitude. Finding a
                    letter from Dario Brando describing his symptoms before his death—symptoms identical to
                    George's—Jonathan suspects
                    foul play. He ventures into the slums of London and befriends the criminal Robert E.O. Speedwagon.
                    Meanwhile, Dio,
                    aware of Jonathan's investigation, attempts to dispose of him by using the mask's spikes and making
                    it appear
                    accidental. To test the mask's effect, Dio uses it on a drunkard, who is transformed into a vampire
                    with superhuman
                    power and eternal youth. The vampire nearly kills Dio but is destroyed by the rising sun. Returning
                    to the Joestar
                    mansion, Dio is ambushed by police. He fatally stabs George Joestar and uses his blood to activate
                    the mask,
                    transforming himself into a vampire. A fight ensues, with Dio killing the policemen and setting the
                    Joestar mansion
                    ablaze. Jonathan ultimately impales Dio on the mansion's Statue of Love and leaves him to die in the
                    fire.</p>
                <p>While hospitalized, Jonathan and Erina's relationship deepens, and she becomes his nurse. Later, they
                    meet Will
                    Antonio Zeppeli, who teaches Jonathan the ancient art of Hamon, a technique used to destroy vampires
                    by converting
                    the body's energy into sunlight. Under Zeppeli's mentorship, Jonathan quickly masters Hamon. They
                    are ambushed by
                    Dio, who has healed from his injuries and raised a zombie army. Dio demonstrates a freezing
                    technique designed to
                    counter Hamon users, forcing Jonathan and Zeppeli to retreat. Confident in his strength, Dio creates
                    two powerful
                    zombie knights, Bruford and Tarkus, to kill Jonathan's group. Bruford fights Jonathan in an
                    honorable duel but is
                    purified by Hamon. Before dying, Bruford thanks Jonathan and gifts him a sword named "Luck," which
                    Jonathan renames
                    "Pluck." Tarkus then traps Jonathan in a chained deathmatch. On the verge of death due to a lack of
                    oxygen, Jonathan
                    is saved by Zeppeli, who sacrifices his life and transfers his energy to Jonathan, allowing him to
                    defeat Tarkus.
                    Zeppeli dies peacefully in Jonathan's arms, bidding farewell to the group.</p>
                <p>Later, Jonathan teams up with three more Hamon users—Tonpetty, Dire, and Straizo—summoned by a letter
                    from Zeppeli.
                    Together, they infiltrate Dio's castle and defeat his zombie horde. During the battle, Dio kills
                    Dire, and the final
                    fight between Jonathan and Dio begins. Initially, Dio appears to have the upper hand with his
                    freezing technique,
                    but Jonathan outsmarts him. By setting himself ablaze to counter Dio's technique, Jonathan uses the
                    Hamon-infused
                    Pluck to split Dio apart. Unaware that Dio has survived by severing his head, Jonathan and his group
                    celebrate,
                    believing they have saved the world.
                    Three months later, on their honeymoon cruise, Jonathan and a now-pregnant Erina are ambushed by
                    Dio, who severely
                    injures Jonathan. Unable to breathe due to his injuries, Jonathan uses the last of his Hamon to jam
                    the ship's
                    engine, triggering an explosion. Dio offers Jonathan eternal life in exchange for salvation, but
                    Jonathan, already
                    resigned to his fate, ignores him. Erina escapes the sinking ship in Dio's coffin and is rescued two
                    days later near
                    the Canary Islands. She vows to keep Jonathan's legacy alive.</p>

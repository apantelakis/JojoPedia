    <h1>Stone Mask: </h1>
    The Stone Mask was a device created by Kars, the leader of the pillar men to attain immunity to the sun. Thought by Dio
    to be a torture device it was later revealed that the tendrils activated by the mask’s contact with human blood, awaken
    the latent ability in a human’s brain, turning them into a vampire.

    <h1>Overview: </h1>
    The Stone Mask made its debut in the first ever chapter of Jojo’s Bizzare Adventures. William A. Zeppeli had first
    excavated the stone mask from aztec ruins in Mexico during an archaeological expedition led by his father, while the
    team was sailing home from the expedition William’s father had accidentally activated the mask turning into a vampire.
    He proceeded to slaughter his whole crew before succumbing to the rays of the sunrise and the mask drifted off into the
    ocean. Eventually the mask was bought by an English woman named Mary Joestar, where it was passed down through the
    family leading to Jonathan’s generation. It was Jonathan Joestar’s research of the stone mask as an archaeologist that
    led to Dio’s curiosity regarding the mask eventually leading him to figuring out the true nature of it, using other
    people’s blood for power. Dio later used it to obtain the latent power himself.

    Speedwagon’s research claimed that when humans wore the mask they could jump 5 times higher than normal, their strength
    tripled, they turned younger and were nigh immortal. However the mask deems the wearer unable to “contain life” making
    them weak to sunlight and hamon and granting them their vampiric nature.

    In Battle Tendency it was revealed that Kars created the stone masks to push his race, the pillar men beyond their
    limits and solve their weakness of sunlight but due to their immortal nature the masks were unable to push the brain
    further unlike it did to humans. He then created a modified version able to fit the “Stone of Aja” which he kept on him
    during his journey to find the stone. When he obtained it after being unsealed it fused with the mask and turned him
    into the self proclaimed Ultimate Lifeform, destroying the mask in the process. The upgraded mask used on a pillar man
    demonstrated complete immunity to the sun and hamon, being able to channel ripple energy due to their new found immunity
    and cellular transformation. Kars claimed he can transform into any creature preexisting or not.

    The stone mask also made brief appearances in Steel Ball Run and JoJolion, showing super natural abilites but not being used to make vampires.

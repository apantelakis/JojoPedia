    Within the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure universe, Stand Arrows are cataclysts of super natural powers that play a crucial role in the
    awakening of Stands, the manifestations of a person's spiritual energy. These mystical arrows are central
    to the series' mythology, driving the plot and introducing significant characters throughout multiple parts.
    <br>
    The Stand Arrows are more than just plot devices they represent the inherent potential and danger associated with the
    pursuit of power. They highlight the duality of human nature, showcasing how the same force can lead to both creation
    and destruction. The arrows also serve as a constant reminder of the interconnectedness of the JoJo's universe, linking
    characters and events across different parts and generations.
   </p>

   <h1>Overview: </h1>
The Stand Arrows made their first offical appearance in Chapter 8 of Jojoâ€™s Bizzare Adventures: Diamond is Unbreakable
where it was revealed that their influence starts from before DIO's era, they are a key plot tool in Diamond is
Unbreakable and Golden Wind. 6 arrows were crafted from a meteor that crashed in Greenland centuries before the events
of the series. <br> The meteorite carries the virus which interacts with an individual's spiritual energy. Those with a strong enough
fighting spirit survive the virus's effects and develop a Stand, which is a physical manifestation of their soul and
life energy. Individuals without sufficient spiritual strength succumb to the virus and perish.
<p>
Stand Arrows appear prominently in several parts of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, serving as key plot devices and catalysts
for character development.
While not explicitly shown, in Stardust Crusaders the origin of DIO's Stand, and subsequently those of the Joestar
bloodline, is implicitly tied to an arrow in his possession, as shown in Part 4.
The stand arrows themselves are first shown in the anime adaptation of Stardust Crusaders. The Nijimura brothers, Keicho
and Okuyasu, use a Stand Arrow to create new Stand users in Morioh, hoping to find someone who can end their father's
suffering, caused by DIO's influence. This leads to the emergence of numerous Stand users, both allies and enemies,
driving the central conflict of the part.
</p>
The Stand Arrows in Golden Wind play a much bigger role and are central to the plot, particularly the unique "Requiem Arrow"
sought after by both the protagonist, Giorno Giovanna, and the antagonist, Diavolo. This special arrow has the power to
evolve Stands into their "Requiem" forms, granting them vastly enhanced and even reality altering abilities at the expense of the arrow ofcourse. 
This requires a much stronger spirit than awakening their stands normally.
<br>
In Part 6 Jolyne Kujo used a shard from one of the stand arrows that was given to her by her father, 
Jotaro to awaken stands in her and her companions, showing that you dont need to be shot with the bow to unlock your spiritual power as long as you come in contact with the virus.
<h1>Variations: </h1>
<h3>-The Requiem Arrow</h3>
Golden Wind introduces a unique and powerful variant of the Stand Arrow: the Requiem Arrow.
<p>
    This specific arrow, distinct in its design, possesses the ability to transform a Stand into its "Requiem" form.
    Requiem
    Stands are vastly more powerful than their original forms, often possessing abilities that defy the natural order or
    manipulate fundamental aspects of reality.
    <br> To achieve Requiem status, a Stand must pierce itself with the Requiem Arrow. This process tests the Stand's
    worthiness and leads to a dramatic transformation, both in appearance and abilities.
</p>
<p>
    The Stands "Gold Experience Requiem" and "Silver Chariot Requiem" are prime examples of this. GER acquired the ability to negate causality, returning all actions against it to "zero" or nothing, 
    while Chariot Requiem gained the ability to force everything around it to sleep (this ability affected all of Rome) and then switch the souls of the sleeping being into the nearest other sleeping being. 
    The power of requiem is so massive that even after Polnareff's death, Chariot Requiem kept fulfilling the user's dying wish of keeping the arrow safe. 
    Their reality-altering abilities are central to the build up and climax of Part 5.
</p>
<h3>-The Devil's Palm</h3>
The Devil's palms form themselves around the corpse of the holy saint's body parts. Similarly to the stand arrows they grant stands to those who pass through them if their spiritual power is strong enough.
<h3>-The Wall Eyes</h3>
The wall eyes were formed after Johnny Joestar planted the saint's corpse into the land of morioh, although different in appearance they work the same as the devil's palm and the stand arrows.
Granting stand abilities to those who come in contact with them, leaving bite marks on those who are strong enough.
